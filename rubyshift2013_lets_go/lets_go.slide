* Hello world!

.play lets_go/hello_world.go

	go run hello_world.go

* Race detector

A major addition to the tools is a race detector, a way to find bugs in concurrent programs. To enable it, set the `-race` flag when building or testing your program.

.play lets_go/race.go

For now, it is only available on 64-bit Linux, OS X, and Windows systems.
